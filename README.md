This package is designed to have data collection and monitoring tools freely accessible during research, especially surveys. Researchers use it to monitor fieldworkers data collection on slack channels and respond timely to correct their mistakes. The package reads an XLS form containing conditions on the collected data and posts messages to relevant slack channels when the conditions are satisfied. Airtime, SMS or Data bundle incentives are awarded to respondents if incentives are associated with the survey. However, this version only works for data stored and collected via surveyCTO.
